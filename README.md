**This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for stock price prediction.**

**This approach leverages the strengths of both architectures:**

- CNNs: Capture spatial features from time series data, identifying patterns within sequences.
- LSTMs: Excel at handling long-term dependencies within time series data, crucial for stock price prediction.
