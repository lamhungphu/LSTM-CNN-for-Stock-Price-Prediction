# Stock price prediction using CNN and LSTM

**This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for stock price prediction.**

**This approach leverages the strengths of both architectures:**

- CNNs: Capture spatial features from time series data, identifying patterns within sequences.
- LSTMs: Excel at handling long-term dependencies within time series data, crucial for stock price prediction.
  
**What's Included:**
- Jupyter Notebooks: LSTM+CNN(10_Companies).ipynb: Whole code for the project.
- Data Folder: Contains 10 preprocessed stock price data ranging from 2012 to 2020

**Getting Started:**
- Download Data and script : Download both data in Input file and LSTM+CNN(10_Companies).ipynb
- Run Jupyter Notebooks: Open the Jupyter notebook environment or Google Colab and run the notebook.

**Disclaimer:**

This is a for-educational-purposes implementation. Stock price prediction is inherently uncertain, and this model should not be used for real-world financial decisions.

**Further Exploration:**

- Experiment with different hyperparameters for the CNN and LSTM networks.
- Explore incorporating additional features like technical indicators or market sentiment data.
- Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate the model's performance on historical data.
- Feel free to contribute!  We welcome pull requests and suggestions for improvement.
